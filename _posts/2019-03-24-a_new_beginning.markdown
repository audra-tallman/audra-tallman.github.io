There were parts of my job that I loved, but definitely parts that were not so good. As a special education teacher, I really enjoyed being able to work with a wide variety of students. I have always been passionate about helping people and in this aspect, my job was very fulfilling. However, demands on teachers only continue to increase while the amount of resourses available continue to decrease. Even though only conttracted for 35 hours per week, I was working more like 50, between all the extra meetings and paperwork that I was required to complete as a part of my job. The stress became too much for my already compromised body and exacerbated my chronic health issues. All of my time and energy was being drained away just trying to make it through each day. I had nothing left when I got home and often had to rest/sleep just to be able to get up and go to work the next day. This was completely unfair to my family and I felt guilty for not spending more time with my husband and one-year-old daughter. I desperately needed a change. 

My husband is a graphic design artist by trade and has been working as a UI/UX designer for the last year. He has had a lot of experience in working with developers and thought it would be something I might enjoy. I started exploring coding and completed several free online introductory courses. He was right. I liked it. Coding seemed to be a combination of mathematics and language. I have always enjoyed math, puzzles and problem solving. There were a lot of similarities between what I already knew about mathematics and what I was learning about in code. I could definitely see myself doing this type of work, so I started doing more research about what it would take to make coding a career. I spoke with several of the developers that my husband works with and was very encouraged. It was a career that many people had switched to from other careers and they seemed to be able to do so relatively easily. By easily, I mean without having to spend a ridiculous amount of time and money to go back to school to get a new degree. I was sold. I continued to take online courses, quit my full-time job as a teacher and secured a part-time job so that I could further pursue coding and find a bootcamp. After researching for several months, my husband and I settled on Flatiron as the best choice and fit for me. After 2 weeks in, I could not be happier about my choice to follow my dreams in pursuit of a new beginning!
