If you've ever taken a geometry class, then you might remember a bit about logic statments. If-then statements sound familiar? Or perhaps you remember spending lots of time writing proofs? Booleans are a bit like that. 

Booleans are basically statements that evaluate to be either "truthy" or "falsey" in coding. There are several different operators that are available in Ruby. 

The main operators utilized are as follows: 

! represents "not"
&& represents "and"
|| represents "or"
 == represents "equal"
 != represents "not equal"
 
 These can also be used in combination with the greater than or lesser than symbols, just like those used in mathematics. 
 
 > represents "greater than"
 < represents "lesser than"
 >= represents "greater than or equal to"
 <= represents "lesser than or equal to"
 
 As you build more and more complex code, having a solid understanding of how boolean operators and statements work will be very beneficial. Other logic statements in Ruby, "if", "elsif" and "else" can be used in comination with boolean operators to evaluate code and provide even greater complexity.
