Conglomeration - "a fancy word for a bunch of stuff brought together." (Vocabulary.com) 

I feel that this is an appropriate way to describe the addition of JavaScript to the Rails project. In order to complete this project, I relied on a lot of different resources - a multitude of websites,  videos and github code. And at this point, I feel that my code reflects it, as it resembes a patch-work quilt made from scraps rather than something that is cohesive and neatly planned. As with any skill, I am certain that I will be able to improve the cohesiveness of my coding. However, thinking about my project, all of the pieces are necessary. The Ruby, JavaScript, JQuery, Fetch and HTML syntaxes are all vital parts of the puzzle in the functionality of this application. They may not be patched together in the prettiest configuration, but they are still working! I look forward to builing more conglomerations in the future and refining my skills in an effort to create beautiful code.
