Project week. I had a ridiculous amount of fear and anxiety leading up to the 1st big project in the Software Engineering Bootcamp. How could I possibly be capable of building such seemingly complex code in such little time? I already felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of material that was being presented. 

Completing this project not only helped to solidify the concepts that I had learned in the previous weeks of bootcamp, but also taught me some very important lessons. Here are a few of my takeaways from the project: 

### * Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help.  

My cohort lead and cohort-mates are amazing. They were able to help me in developing and debugging my code when I would get stuck. Could I have eventually figured it out on my own? Probably, but by getting another set of eyes on my code and drawing from someone else's knowledge and experiences, I was able to learn a lot more from them than I would have been able to get from scanning and reading what can seem like an endless number of resources available on the internet. 

### * Just worry about one line of code at a time.

I have a tendency to get ahead of myself and tend to make things more complicated than they need to be. I started out by trying to build all of my classes and methods at once, thinking that I would save time by doing it this way. Boy, was I wrong!  My program didn't run as I had expected it to, but I had no idea where I had made the mistake. I ended up scrapping what I had and starting over from scratch.  By slowing down and really focusing on coding one line at a time, one method at a time, one class at a time, I was able to test the parts of my code as I built it and was much more successful in getting my code to function as I had intended.
