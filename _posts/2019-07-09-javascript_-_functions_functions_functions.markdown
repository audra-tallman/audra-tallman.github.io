Javascript is all about functions, similar to Ruby and all of it's methods. Beginning to learn a new language, after finally feeling comfortable with Ruby, was intimidating and challenging. It really is like learning a whole new foreign language. And similarly, I think it is beneficial to immerse yourself as much as possible. 

In addition to the resources provided by FlatIron through the Learn curriculum, I have found a site that has quickly become my go to for programming info and has tons of other interesting content as well. That site is [Medium](https://medium.com/topic/software-engineering). If you haven't already come across this site, I would definitley recommend it. There are lots of helpful articles on Javascript and many other programming languages too. 

As I try to wade through this new language, something from one of college classes on Cognitive Psychology comes to mind. My professor explained, that in order for us to really learn or understand something,  not only the more exposure, the better, but also the more perspectives about a piece of information the better one understands and remembers something. So here's to pouring over what seems like an endless amount of Javascript functions!
