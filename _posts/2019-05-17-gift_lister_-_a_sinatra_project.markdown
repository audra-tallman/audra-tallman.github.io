In brainstorming for the project, I tried to think of ideas that would both meet the requirements and be something meaningful/useful. This lead me to the idea for an app to keep track of the gift ideas that I get for people, but can never seem to remember when a gift giving occasion rolls around. 

There were a few parts of this project that proved to be quite difficult for me. The first was just getting everything set up with the config and environment files in order to get it working in the web browser. Once I was able to establish a connection, it was pretty smooth sailing until I had issues with some of my migrations. I "love" migrations so much that my cohort lead has affectionately deemed me the "Migration Queen" as she helped me to work through the issues that I was having. I am determined to figure these migration things out!

Another thing that I learned with this project is that while choosing the most accurate name for some one recieving a gift seemed like the most logical thing to do, it was definitely not the most practical as I encountered numerous typos throughout my code which often got me hung up. Word of advice - choose names that are easy to spell!
