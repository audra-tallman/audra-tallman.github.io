This project definitely had my head exploding! 

When it comes to react and redux, there are A LOT of important pieces in the puzzle in order to get your app up and running correctly. The initial set up seemed to be quite easy and straightforward . With these magic words in your terminal```npx create-react-app```followed by the name of your app and a bit of patience, because lets face it, any commands beginning with npx or npm is going to take more time than you may be used to when it comes to running commands in your terminal. From there, I simply followed the lecture and example that my cohort lead had walked us through by installing redux, react-redux and redux-thunk. The next part involved setting up index. js, App.js, creating  my store as well as a root reducer, and adding in a proxy for my back-end API. With this inital set up taken care of, redux was ready to go! 

From there, I built out my first smart component, corresponding reducer, and actions. I was even able to create a form and have it persist input to my backend API. EXCITING STUFF!!! I mistakenly thought the rest would be just as simple, and it's likely that it could have been a lot more simple, but because of how I chose to set up my API, including associations and serializer, it became a lot more complicated than I initially imagined.  

Throughout the rest of my project, I relied on multiple sources of information to help me. I came across several React/Redux tutorials on youtube by Bucky Roberts.  I found his videos to be super helpful and very informative. I would definitely recommend checking them out. I learned a lot more about react/redux and he outlined steps to take in building a functional app. 

This is what I felt like I was doing in react/redux:

This is the process that is most logical to take, as outlined by Bucky Roberts in his videos:

After much trial and errror, I finally have a functional app. There are still several functions that I would like to add to my app to improve it's usability, but I feel like its a really good starting point for my first react/redux app. I am in hopes that as I continue to work with react/redux  now that I have a better understanding of the steps to take and each peice works together, there will be fewer brain explosion moments!
